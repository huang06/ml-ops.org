This site provides the description of the practices and the current state in MLOps: the quickly evolving field of machine learning, software engineering and operations.


## [Motivation for MLOps](content/motivation.md)

You will learn why you might want to use Machine Learning and about various scenarios of change that need to be managed and the iterative nature of ML-based software development. Finally, we provide the MLOps definition and show the evolution of MLOps.
   
## [Implementing ML: Phase Zero](content/phase-zero.md)

This part is devoted to one of the most important phase in any software project such as understanding the business problem and requirements for the ML-based software.

## [End-to-End ML Workflow Lifecycle](content/end-to-end-ml-workflow.md) 

We provide here a high-level overview of a typical workflow for machine learning-based software development.

## [Three levels of ML-based software]()

You will learn about three core elements of ML-based software Data, ML models, and Code. In particular, we will talk about 
   * Data Engineering Pipelines
   * Machine Learning Pipelines and ML workflows.
   * Model Serving Patterns and Deployment Strategies

## [MLOps Principles]() 

In this part, we describe best practices and tools to test, deploy, manage, and monitor ML models in real-world production.


## [State-of-MLOps (Tools & Frameworks)]() 

This part presents an overview of software tools and frameworks that manage ML artifacts and cover the whole machine learning cycle.

## [Use-cases and Demos]()
