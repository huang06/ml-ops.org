With Machine Learning Model Operationalization Management (MLOps), we believe to provide an end-to-end machine learning development process to design, build and manage reproducible, testable, and evolvable ML-powered software.

According to the [Cognilytica](https://www.cognilytica.com/2020/03/03/ml-model-management-and-operations-2020-mlops/) Report "ML Model Management and Operations 2020", *"the market for MLOps Solutions is growing from a nascent $350M in 2019 to almost $4B by 2025"*.

Being an emerging field, MLOps is rapidly gaining momentum amongst Data Scientists, ML Engineers and AI enthusiasts. Following this trend, the [*Continuous Delivery Foundation SIG MLOps*](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-mlops) differentiates the ML models management from traditional software engineering and suggests the following directions for MLOps development:

  * MLOps aims to unify the release cycle for machine learning and software application release.
  * MLOps enables automated testing of machine learning artifacts (data validation, model testing, machine learning model integration testing)
  * MLOps enables the application of agile principles to machine learning projects.
  * MLOps enables supporting machine learning models and datasets to build these models as first-class citizens within CI/CD systems.
  * MLOps reduces technical debt across machine learning models.
  * MLOps must be a language-, framework-, platform-, and infrastructure-agnostic practice. 

This site describes the practices and the current state in MLOps: the quickly evolving field of machine learning, software engineering and operations. Please note, we expect a basic familiarity with machine learning concepts. For more resources to learn about machine learning, please refer to our [References page](content/references.md).


## Motivation for MLOps

You will learn why you might want to use Machine Learning and about various scenarios of change that need to be managed and the iterative nature of ML-based software development. Finally, we provide the MLOps definition and show the evolution of MLOps. [more...](content/motivation.md)
   
## Designing ML-powered Software

This part is devoted to one of the most important phase in any software project such as understanding the business problem and requirements for the ML-based software. [more...](content/phase-zero.md)

## End-to-End ML Workflow Lifecycle

We provide here a high-level overview of a typical workflow for machine learning-based software development. [more...](content/end-to-end-ml-workflow.md) 

## [Three Levels of ML-based Software (coming soon) ]()

You will learn about three core elements of ML-based software Data, ML models, and Code. In particular, we will talk about 
   * Data Engineering Pipelines
   * Machine Learning Pipelines and ML workflows.
   * Model Serving Patterns and Deployment Strategies

## [MLOps Principles (coming soon)]() 

In this part, we describe principles and established practices to test, deploy, manage, and monitor ML models in production.


## [State-of-MLOps (Tools & Frameworks)(coming soon)]() 

This part presents an overview of software tools and frameworks that manage ML artifacts and cover the whole machine learning cycle.
