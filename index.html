                <p>Being an emerging field, MLOps is rapidly gaining momentum amongst Data Scientists, ML Engineers and AI enthusiasts. Following this trend, the <a href="https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-mlops">Continuous Delivery Foundation SIG MLOps</a> differentiates the ML models management from traditional software engineering and suggests the following MLOps capabilities:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>MLOps aims to unify the release cycle for machine learning and software application release.</li>
                    <li>MLOps enables automated testing of machine learning artifacts (e.g. data validation, ML model testing, and ML model integration testing)</li>
                    <li>MLOps enables the application of agile principles to machine learning projects.</li>
                    <li>MLOps enables supporting machine learning models and datasets to build these models as first-class citizens within CI/CD systems.</li>
                    <li>MLOps reduces technical debt across machine learning models.</li>
                    <li>MLOps must be a language-, framework-, platform-, and infrastructure-agnostic practice.</li>

                    <p>You will learn for what to use Machine Learning, about various scenarios of change that need to be managed and the iterative nature of ML-based software development. Finally, we provide the MLOps definition and show the evolution of MLOps.</p>
